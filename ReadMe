Design and Assumptions
-----------------------
- Design in based around splitting the input into three categories:
    - translation text (e.g. glob is I)
    - material conversion text (e.g glob glob Silver is 34 Credits) which is used to work out the unit cost of the material
    - questions

- The translation text is converted into a map lookup based on interglactic text -> RomanNumeral

- For each material the unit cost is calculated

- Using the above info the questions are answered:
    - convert every galactic word into a Roman Numeral
    - calculate the roman numeral total in decimal value for the numerals collected in the previous step
    - multiply the amount by the nit cost of the material to get the total worth

- All code written using TDD




Instructions To Build And Run
-------------------------------

Prerequisites: Maven (v3.2.1) and Java 8

1. Extract zip file to a directory of choice
2. At the root of that directory run: mvn clean install - this will compile, run tests and build the application jar
3. Go to /target directory
4. Run app with test input file(included in zip): java -jar MerchantsGuideToTheGalaxy-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ../src/test/resources/TestInputFile

This should show the inputs and output as specified in the assignment.
